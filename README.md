#  Offensive Language Detection on Twitter using NLP  
An academic project that leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** to automatically identify offensive or inappropriate language in tweets. This system supports social media platforms in moderating harmful content and improving user safety.  

## 📌 Project Title  
**A Natural Language Processing-powered Approach for Identifying Inappropriate Language on Twitter**  

## 📘 Abstract  
The widespread use of social media platforms like Twitter has resulted in increased instances of offensive, toxic, and inappropriate content. Manual moderation is no longer scalable. This project proposes a machine learning-based text classification system that uses NLP techniques to detect offensive language in tweets. It extracts features from text using vectorization techniques and trains classifiers like Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes to make predictions.  

## ⚙️ Technologies & Tools Used  
**Language**: Python 
**Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn 
**NLP**: CountVectorizer, TF-IDF, Tokenization, Stopword Removal, Stemming 
**ML Models**: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes 
**Evaluation**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score 
**Environment**: Jupyter Notebook / Python Scripts
